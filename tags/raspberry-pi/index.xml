      <description>As part of the Coursera Specialization course on Tensorflow deployment, RP4 is used to demonstrate TF-lite. It it based on a somewhat older version of TF and other libraries, hence installing it on a fresh device took some effort. The object detection example asumed a RP-camera, which I did not have. I used an Intel Realsense D435 camera which required manual steps to install on the RP. There are many resources on the internet about installing TF2 on the PR, therefore I will not go into all details here, and focus on the tricky parts I bumped into.</description>
