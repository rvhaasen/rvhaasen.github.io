      <description>When using SSH you may run into the &amp;lsquo;backspace problem&amp;rsquo;, effectively not being able to erase characters. Until recent, I could solve this problem by setting the terminal environment-variable. This however did not work the last time, and I had to find another solution. This blog describes how I solved it.
First step is to get the termaps. In my case, these were not available and I had to install them first.</description>
