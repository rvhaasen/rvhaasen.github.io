      <description>When using SSH on a regular basis on all kind of hosts, at some moment you may run into the &amp;lsquo;backspace problem&amp;rsquo;, effectively not being able to erase characters entered from the keyboard. This is the result of a mismatch between expected and provided capabilities of the terminal. Until recent, I could solve this problem by just setting the terminal environment-variable. This however did not work the last time that I encountered this problem, and I had to find another solution.</description>
