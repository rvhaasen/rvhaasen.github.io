      <description>There are many ways to create simple good-looking websites for personal usage. Until recently I put my tech-blogging in Confluence ( which is the main documentation system at my work). Work-related info should ofcourse be shielded from the outside, non-confidential subjects (&amp;lsquo;hobby projects&amp;rsquo;) could however be stored somewhere else. I bumped into &amp;lsquo;Hugo&amp;rsquo; and immediatly got enthousiastic about the concept. The result is the blogging site that you are looking at.</description>

      <description>Already 2 years ago I wanted to build a Prusa MK3 printer. Last years black-friday, Prusa had an interesting offer which i could not refuse!
The box arrived last week of 2020. It took me slight more than 2 days to assemble the printer. The package contains a book with clear instructions. Having build a first one, a second printer would take much less time, I think it could then be build in about 1.</description>

      <description>Rabbit gone&amp;hellip; The first post on my site is a sad one :-(
For almost 10 year our rabbit was part of the family. It survived two marter attack which killed 2 other rabbits. After 30 Decmber 2020 the rabbit somehow disappeared. Most likely it got sick, went under ground through the tunnels and died&amp;hellip;
This makes creating blog-like websites very easy!
