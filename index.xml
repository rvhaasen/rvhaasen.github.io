      <description>When using SSH you may run into the &amp;lsquo;backspace problem&amp;rsquo;, effectively not being able to erase characters. Until recent, I could solve this problem by setting the terminal environment-variable. This however did not work the last time, and I had to find another solution. This blog describes how I solved it.
First step is to get the termaps. In my case, these were not available and I had to install them first.</description>

      <title>Tensorflow on RP4</title>

      <description>As part of the Coursera Specialization course on Tensorflow deployment, RP4 is used to demonstrate TF-lite. It it based on a somewhat older version of TF and other libraries, hence installing it on a fresh device took some effort. The object detection example asumed a RP-camera, which I did not have. I used an Intel Realsense D435 camera which required manual steps to install on the RP. There are many resources on the internet about installing TF2 on the PR, therefore I will not go into all details here, and focus on the tricky parts I bumped into.</description>

      <description>Setup One of the usecases possible with emulating RPi on a pc is to create RP images. Although Docker can be used to create images, Packer is a very interesting alternative. By using packer, the configuration for Docker and Packer can be harmonized. This gives flexibility for deploying the images, because configuration/image creation can also be used without Docker. It makes &amp;lsquo;infrastructure as code&amp;rsquo; possible. Start with an empty Pi and apply the configuration programmaticaly.</description>

      <description>There are many ways to create simple good-looking websites for personal usage. Until recently I put my tech-blogging in Confluence ( which is the main documentation system at my work). Work-related info should ofcourse be shielded from the outside, non-confidential subjects (&amp;lsquo;hobby projects&amp;rsquo;) could however be stored somewhere else. I bumped into &amp;lsquo;Hugo&amp;rsquo; and immediatly got enthousiastic about the concept. The result is the blogging site that you are looking at.</description>

      <description>Already 2 years ago I wanted to build a Prusa MK3 printer. Last years black-friday, Prusa had an interesting offer which i could not refuse!
The box arrived last week of 2020. It took me slight more than 2 days to assemble the printer. The package contains a book with clear instructions. Having build a first one, a second printer would take much less time, I think it could then be build in about 1.</description>

      <description>Rabbit gone&amp;hellip; The first post on my site is a sad one :-(
For almost 10 year our rabbit was part of the family. It survived two marter attacks where 2 other rabbits were killed. After 30 Decmber 2020 the rabbit somehow disappeared. Most likely it got sick, went under ground through the tunnels and died&amp;hellip;</description>
